# Huffman-Code
A program created to implement the Huffman Code algorithm to encode some data to squeezed size, create a special code with the help of 
which the encoded data can be decoded, and finally decode the encoded data using the code to the original data with the original size.

The program is implemented with highly efficient data structures such as heaps on tree data structures, stacks, queues and maps.
